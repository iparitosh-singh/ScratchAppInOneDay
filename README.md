# Scratch starter project

To get started:

- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- Run `npm start` and open http://localhost:3000 to see the app

#### How I made it
Is built using React js, and React DnD library.
Multiple 'Sprites' can have different command sets 

PS: Only had 1 day to build to it, The run functionality and commands attaching to each other doesn't work
